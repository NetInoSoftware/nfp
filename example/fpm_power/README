FPM_POWER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fpm_power targets power saving by sleeping workers when there is no
packet coming for a long time. The workers are awakened through the use of
RX interrupts.

Requirements:

- fpm_power requires a custom ODP-DPDK functionality provided as a patch within
the example folder. The patch is to be applied on top of odp-dpdk repository at
'v1.41.0.0_DPDK_22.11' tag and takes effect for 'linux-generic' platform,
'dpdk' pktio.

- fpm_power requires an nfp built with '--enable-power-example' configuration
option. It enables the build of fpm_power example and additional
functionalities.
e.g.
$ ./configure ..other options... --enable-power-example
